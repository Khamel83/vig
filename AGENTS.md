# ONE_SHOT v7.4

> **UPDATE CHECK**: If this version is old, run: `curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Khamel83/oneshot/master/oneshot.sh | bash`

> **Context is the scarce resource.** Delegate aggressively, parallelize always, write state to disk.

## AUTO-DELEGATION (v7.4)

**CRITICAL**: These fire AUTOMATICALLY without user request.

```yaml
auto_delegation:
  # File count triggers (>5 files → delegate)
  - signal: "Glob/Grep returning >5 files"
    action: "Spawn Explore agent, return summary only"

  # Duration triggers (>15s → background)
  - signal: "npm|pytest|docker|build command"
    action: "run_in_background: true"

  # Security triggers (auto-audit)
  - signal: "Editing auth/secrets/credentials files"
    action: "Spawn security-auditor in background"

  # Context triggers (pre-emptive)
  - signal: "Context >30% + complex task"
    action: "Delegate exploration to subagent"
  - signal: "Context >50%"
    action: "Create handoff, delegate remaining"
```

**Key change from v7.3:** Bias toward delegation. Don't wait for user to say "background".

---

## RESILIENT EXECUTION (v7.4)

**All long-running work runs in tmux** - survives terminal disconnect.

```yaml
resilience:
  # Default: All builds use tmux
  - command: "oneshot-build"
    mode: tmux_session
    heartbeat: 30s
    checkpoint: 5m

  # Aggressive state sync
  - trigger: "task status change"
    action: "bd sync immediately"
  - trigger: "file committed"
    action: "bd sync"
  - trigger: "every 5 minutes"
    action: "checkpoint commit + bd sync"

  # Recovery
  - on_disconnect: "work continues in tmux"
  - on_reconnect: "tmux attach -t oneshot-*"
  - on_crash: "bd sync && bd ready to resume"
```

**Key principle:** If terminal dies, work continues. If work dies, state is recoverable.

---

## CONTEXT MANAGEMENT

### Task Groups (3-5 tasks each)
```
Plan has N tasks → Create beads tasks with dependencies
Execute one group → bd update status → Check context
If context > 50% → Pause, bd sync, suggest /compact
After /compact → bd ready shows exactly what's next
```

### Beads = Persistent State
All task progress tracked via beads (survives /clear, /compact, sessions):
```bash
bd ready --json     # What's next?
bd update <id> --status in_progress
bd close <id> --reason "commit: abc123"
bd sync             # Always sync before session end
```

### Pre-Implementation Flow
```
If context > 30% before implement-plan:
  → bd sync (save current state)
  → Suggest /compact first
```

| Priority | File | Purpose |
|----------|------|---------|
| 1 | CLAUDE.md | Project-specific rules |
| 2 | AGENTS.md | This file (skill routing) |
| 3 | `.beads/` | Persistent task state (bd ready) |
| 4 | TODO.md | Session visibility |

| "think" | Quick check |
| "think hard" | Trade-offs |
| "ultrathink" | Architecture |
| "super think" | System design |
| "mega think" | Strategic |

## PHILOSOPHY

> "It's harder to read code than to write it." — Joel Spolsky

**NEVER rewrite from scratch.** Extend, refactor, use existing solutions.

**USER TIME IS PRECIOUS. AGENT COMPUTE IS CHEAP.**
Ask ALL questions UPFRONT. Get ALL info BEFORE coding.

---

## RESET

Say `(ONE_SHOT)` to re-anchor to these rules.

**Version**: 7.4 | **Core Skills**: 20 | **Advanced**: 17 | **Beads**: Required | **Auto-Delegation**: Aggressive | **Resilient**: tmux

## Landing the Plane (Session Completion)

**When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:
   ```bash
   git pull --rebase
   bd sync
   git push
   git status  # MUST show "up to date with origin"
   ```
5. **Clean up** - Clear stashes, prune remote branches
6. **Verify** - All changes committed AND pushed
7. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds
- NEVER stop before pushing - that leaves work stranded locally
- NEVER say "ready to push when you are" - YOU must push
- If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds
